	<h2>One Tool to Rule Them All</h2>
	<p class="lead">
		YADT is a next generation data center deployment and system management tool.
		It is based on two central components: central management of dependencies between services,
		systems and software packages, and using package based deployment for both
		software and configuration management.

		<h3>YADT is human-readable</h3>
		<p>
			YADT lets you model your data center landscape in a simple, human readable yaml format. The packaging 
			of software and its configuration, the definition of package dependencies, the definition of service
			dependencies, and some basic conventions are the YADT model. With these information, YADT can deploy
			any changes to your software and your configuration to any number of hosts. Of course YADT will also
			deploy all updates to your OS, you can even separate these OS updates from your application and
			configuration updates.

		<h3>YADT understands your data center</h3>
		<p>
			YADT assures that the updates and service restarts are done in the correct order over your
			complete data center. YADT does this by analyzing the service and package dependencies, grouping
			dependent services and hosts together into "chunks". It then rolls out the update as a sequential 
			wave over all chunks, thus assuring that your platform as a whole stays available during this 
			process.
		</p>
		<p>
			YADT also provides a way to collaboratively administer a large number of hosts concurrently by many
			users. It provides an audit trail of who did what, when, and on which host.
