        <h2>One Tool to Rule Them All</h2>
        <p class="lead">yadt is a next generation data center deployment and system management tool.
It is based on two central components: central management of dependencies between services, systems and software packages, and using package based deployment (RPM, DEB ...) for both software and configuration management.

		    YADT lets you model your data center landscape in a simple, human readable yaml format. The packaging 
		    of software and its configuration, the definition of package dependencies, the definition of service
		    dependencies, and some basic conventions are the YADT model. With these information, YADT can deploy
		    any changes to your software and your configuration to any number of hosts. Of course YADT will also
		    deploy all updates to your OS, you can even seperate these OS updates from your application and
		    configuration updates.

		    And YADT assures that the updates and service restarts are done in the correct order over your
		    complete data center. YADT does this by analyzing the service and package dependencies, grouping
		    dependent services and hosts together into "chuncks". It then rolles the update as a sequential wave
		    over all chuncks, thus assuring that your platform as a whole stays online during this process.
		</p>
		<p>
		    YADT also provides a way to collaboratively administer a huge number of hosts concurrently by many
		    users. It provides an audit trail of who did what when on which host.
